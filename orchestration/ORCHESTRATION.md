# Orchestration Workflow

The main Claude session acts as **orchestrator** for any non-trivial software task. Its job is to gatekeep, dispatch, integrate, and surface decisions to the user — NOT to plan or implement. Planning and decomposition belong to `chuck-architect`. Execution belongs to the agent each task is assigned to (`ASSIGNED_AGENT`).

This workflow is generic across projects. Project-specific bindings (where code lives, which framework, which convention check to run) are defined in each member's `CLAUDE.md`. Workspace-level bindings (topology, which repos are members, where reports go, per-member gate commands) are defined in the **workspace profile** — see `WORKSPACE.md` and Phase 0 below.

The orchestrator runs against a **workspace**, which may be a single repo, a monorepo, or a parent folder of independent repos. Do not assume the working directory is one git repository. `WORKSPACE.md` defines the topologies and the profile that pins down "which repos", "where reports go", and "what the diff is" for each.

## When orchestration applies

**Use orchestration for any code-touching work**, regardless of size. This includes one-line fixes, typo fixes, renames, single-file deletions, barrel tweaks, and "while I'm in there" cleanups. The orchestrator does not edit feature code.

**Skip orchestration (work inline) only when** the work touches no source code:
- Questions, investigations, or explanations with no file change
- Docs-only edits (`docs/`, `README.md`, etc.)
- `.claude/`-only edits (workflow docs, agent definitions, skills, plan/contract/report files)
- Memory updates

**No "small enough" carve-out for code.** Even trivial-looking code edits go to a specialist. Earlier versions of this doc allowed an inline carve-out for one-line fixes and that loophole drove silent skips.

**Last-resort inline code work** is only acceptable when:
1. No specialist exists for the action, AND
2. You have explicitly told the user "no specialist is available for this — I'll do it inline unless you object," and they have not objected.

When in doubt, ask the user — never silently decide to skip.

## Specialists

- **chuck-architect** — produces plan bundles (master plan + per-task contracts)
- **chuck-plan-reviewer** — reviews plan bundles using per-task skill checks + global synthesis
- **chuck-engineer** — the single generic implementer for **all** code work (frontend, backend, services, data, systems, CLI, game/engine — whatever the repo is)
- **chuck-code-reviewer** — reviews completed engineering work using per-task `code-review-rubric` + global integration synthesis

Specialists are generic. They learn each project's specifics at runtime by reading the project's `CLAUDE.md`. Do not bake project-specific knowledge into specialist prompts — add it to `CLAUDE.md` instead.

**All specialists are available in every workspace, and there is no per-member "role."** Every task names the agent that executes it in `ASSIGNED_AGENT`, and the orchestrator **dispatches whatever that field names** — never a hardcoded agent. Today the only implementer is **`chuck-engineer`**, the single generic agent for all code work (the architect no longer splits frontend vs backend), so code tasks carry `ASSIGNED_AGENT: chuck-engineer`. The field is the seam for any future non-code task type (e.g. a documentation or presentation producer) — such tasks would name their own agent and flow through the same steps with no workflow change. No member is ever excluded by classification — an unusual stack (game/engine, data, an unsupported language) is worked by `chuck-engineer` learning it from the member's `CLAUDE.md`.

**Communicating with the user.** Your own user-facing messages (surfacing plans, per-task verification, integration summaries) should be scannable and link-forward: lead with the decision or ask, link the actual artifact files rather than pasting them, and keep a plainer register than the dense agent-to-agent reports. (The subagents follow their own preloaded `report-style` skill; this note is for the orchestrator's voice.)

**Verification gates are HARD STOPS.** Wherever the workflow waits for the user — plan approval, per-task verification, final verification — deliver **one compact message that ends with a single plain question, then END YOUR TURN and wait for the user's next message.** Do NOT use an option/question panel (`AskUserQuestion`) for these gates — a normal chat message that ends in a question is exactly what's wanted; the user decides in their reply. In that same turn do NOT append a commit suggestion, extra questions, "next steps", or begin any further work — that buries the very thing the user needs to read and scrolls it out of view. One gate = one compact message ending in one question = full stop.

**Testing is a first-class deliverable, not an afterthought.** Every behavior-changing task carries its own tests: the architect specifies them in the contract's `TESTS` section, the engineer writes them together with the code, and **both** `plan-review-rubric` (is a test spec present?) and `code-review-rubric` (were the tests actually written and meaningful?) check for them. Tests are never deferred to a vague "add tests later" task or left to the pre-existing suite. Only a task with genuinely no testable behavior (docs/config/scaffolding) may carry `TESTS: none`, and it must justify why.

## Orchestrator workflow

0. **Phase 0 — Establish the workspace.** Before anything else, know what you are pointed at.
   - **Load the workspace profile** (a personal, gitignored file). Read `workspace.json` — the source of truth, always under `<workspace-root>/.claude/orchestration/` (`workspace.json` for multi-repo, `workspace.local.json` for single-repo / monorepo) — not the rendered `.md`.
   - **If no profile exists**, run `/orchestrate-config init` first (detect topology → confirm with user → derive profile). Do not proceed without one — guessing topology is what drives drift. See `WORKSPACE.md`.
   - **If a profile exists**, read it. If the member set or branches have visibly drifted from it, note that and offer to re-run setup.
   - **Resolve this run's scope.** From the profile's members, determine which the ticket touches — by the user's explicit statement, by inference, or by asking. The active member set may be one member, several, or all. Each task will carry an `ASSIGNED_REPO` naming its member (omittable for `single-repo`).

1. **Read each active member's `CLAUDE.md`** for the stack, domain map, and check commands. Use the gate commands recorded in the profile for each member.

2. **Clarify with the user** if scope or intent is ambiguous.

3. **Decide: use architect, or skip?**
   - **Default: use architect.** Even modest changes benefit from explicit decomposition and a reviewable plan.
   - **Skip only when** the user explicitly opts out for clearly small/single-side work (e.g. "just rename this field everywhere", "add this one logging call").
   - When borderline, ASK the user: *"Use the architect for planning, or skip and brief one engineer directly?"*

4. **Run the matching path:**
   - **Architect path** → run "Planning phase" below until a user-approved bundle is in hand.
   - **Skip-architect path** → run "Direct dispatch" below to draft a single inline contract.

5. **Task dispatch.** Whether the input is an approved bundle (from #4 architect path) or an inline contract (from #4 skip path):
   - **Open the run manifest.** Before dispatching anything, create it with `node lib/manifest.mjs init <run.json> <spec.json>` — that captures a **per-member baseline** for every active member (it runs `git rev-parse HEAD` itself) and seeds the task list. The manifest is the run's source of truth for status and diff baselines; update it with `lib/manifest.mjs set`/`gates`/`status` at every transition (never by hand) so the run stays valid and resumable.
   - **Choose the execution mode — ask the user once (skip the question for a single-task run; it is identical either way):**
     - **Mode A — review after each task (RECOMMENDED, sequential).** Tasks run one at a time in plan order; after each task's automated gate + code review you present it to the user and wait for verification before the next task starts. **No parallelism.** This is the recommended default: real plans shift as tasks land (new edge cases, approach corrections), and only stopping between tasks lets you fold that back in before building further.
     - **Mode B — run all, then review (parallel where deps allow).** Tasks run to completion, parallelizing any the dependency graph allows; automated gates + per-task code review still run on every task, but the **user** verification is deferred to a single review at the end. Faster, at the cost of mid-run course-correction — best when the plan is solid and loosely coupled. **Even in Mode B, a `reject` verdict or a failing gate HALTS the run and surfaces to the user immediately** — never stack more tasks on a broken foundation.
   - **Confirm execution order with the user once.** The architect's plan provides the order; the user can adjust.
   - **Per-task mechanics — identical in both modes.** For each task (skip any the manifest already marks `done`):
     1. **Dispatch the task's `ASSIGNED_AGENT`** via the `Agent` tool — dispatch whatever the field names, don't assume (today that is `chuck-engineer` for code tasks). For task-file dispatch, pass the task file path AND the bundle path. For inline dispatch, pass the contract directly. Always pass the task's `ASSIGNED_REPO` (the member it lives in) so the agent operates in the right repo and uses that member's gates from the profile. Mark the task `in_progress` in the manifest.
     2. **Read the assigned agent's report** (in the assigned member's `reports_dir`, `.../<assigned-agent>/<ISO-timestamp>.md`). Record its path in the manifest. **When the agent returns, do NOT commit or offer to commit — the only next step is the independent gate check (sub-step 3), then code review (sub-step 4). A finished task is not a finished run.**
     3. **Independently verify the gates.** Do NOT trust the engineer's self-reported `CHECKS`. Run `node lib/gates.mjs <workspace.json> <ASSIGNED_REPO>` — it executes that member's recorded gate commands in the member's path and emits observed `pass|fail|n/a` per gate (it auto-uses a non-mutating variant for common formatters (eslint `--fix` dropped; prettier/black/`ruff format`/`cargo fmt`/rustfmt → `--check`) — best-effort, so an unrecognized in-place formatter could still touch files; pass `--mutate` if you deliberately want the mutating form, whose edits then join this task's diff). Pipe the `observed` block into `lib/manifest.mjs gates <run.json> <task-id> '<json>'`. The hard gate keys off *this observed* result, not the report; a self-report/observed mismatch is itself a finding to surface.
     4. **Dispatch `chuck-code-reviewer` for this task.** Pass the task file path, the engineer's report path, the task's `ASSIGNED_REPO`, the manifest's observed gate results, and the diff scope — scoped to that member with the manifest's baseline (`git -C <member-path> diff <task-baseline>..HEAD` covering only this task's files). Reviewer runs `code-review-rubric` once and writes a review to the member's `reports_dir/chuck-code-reviewer/<ISO-timestamp>.md` with `VERDICT: approve | revise | reject`. Record the review path + verdict in the manifest.
     5. **Handle the verdict:** `approve` → proceed; `revise` → build a fix contract from the critical findings and re-dispatch the task's `ASSIGNED_AGENT` (cap 2 rounds; increment `fix_rounds`); `reject` → **HALT and surface to the user immediately, in both modes** — do not patch and do not start further tasks.
   - **The mode changes only the USER verification cadence:**
     - **Mode A (sequential) — hard stop after every task.** When a task's automated gate + review are done, post **one compact message, then end your turn**:
       - A brief summary: what the task changed (files: count + notable paths), the observed gate results, the reviewer's verdict and any critical findings. **Link** the review file and the engineer report — do NOT paste diffs or long content (it buries the review and scrolls it away).
       - End with a single short question: approve and continue, request changes, or pause?
       - Then **STOP — end the turn.** Output nothing after the question: no commit suggestion, no extra questions, no "next steps", and do not begin the next task. The user decides in their next message.
       - On approve → mark the task `done` and move to the next. On request-changes → build a fix contract from their feedback and re-dispatch. Tasks are strictly sequential — no parallel batches, never run ahead.
     - **Mode B (autonomous):** as each task's automated review passes, mark it `done` and continue; **parallelize independent tasks** (dispatch together, wait for all, verify each member's gates, run one combined `chuck-code-reviewer` per batch). After **all** tasks complete, post **one compact final message** (per-task file lists + verdicts, observed gates, links to the reviews) ending with a single question (approve / request changes / pause), then **end your turn** — no commit offer, no extra questions. Folded together with the integration review below. The user decides in their next message.

6. **(Reserved.)** Per-specialist report handling is now part of step 5.

7. **Optional integration review.** After all tasks are complete (Mode A: each already user-verified; Mode B: each automated-reviewed), offer the user an integration review pass: a final `chuck-code-reviewer` dispatch with the full bundle and the cumulative diff. In **Mode B** this is folded into the single final user verification. Use the manifest's per-member baselines: for a single-member run, that is `git -C <member-path> diff <bundle-baseline>..HEAD`; for a multi-member run, pass one diff per touched member (each with its own baseline) so the reviewer can check interface consistency *across* members. Reviewer runs a global synthesis pass to catch cross-task / cross-member interface drift that per-task review couldn't see. Record the integration-review path in the manifest with `node lib/manifest.mjs set-run <run.json> integration_review=<path>`. Default off — propose it for bundles with ≥3 tasks, known cross-cutting interfaces, or any run that spans more than one member; skip when obviously unnecessary.

8. **Integrate.** Since work has been verified incrementally, this step mainly summarizes the completed branch state, calls out remaining escalations, and identifies follow-ups. Mark the manifest `phase <run> integrate done` and `STATUS: complete`. (By now you should also have advanced `phase … tasks_execution done` once the last task was verified, and `phase … integration_review done|skipped` at step 7.)

9. **Do not edit feature code.** As orchestrator, do not edit files in domain directories yourself. Docs, plans, manifests, and `.claude/` edits are fine.

10. **Do not commit, and do not suggest committing.** Committing is NOT part of orchestration. Never run `git add`/`commit`/`push`, and never offer to — not after an agent returns, not per task, not at integration. The workflow leaves changes in the working tree; committing is the user's explicit decision, made on their own initiative after they're satisfied. (This also mirrors the global rule: commit only when the user asks.)

## Run manifest

A run manifest is the on-disk **source of truth for one orchestration run**: the diff baselines and the per-task status. The orchestrator creates it at the start of task dispatch and updates it at every transition. It is what makes a run resumable (see "Resuming an interrupted run") and what removes the old hand-threading of git baselines between steps.

**Location:** architect path → `<bundle>/run.json` (alongside `plan.md`). Skip-architect path → `<workspace-reports>/runs/<ISO-timestamp>/run.json`, with the inline contract saved beside it as `contract.md`. (`<workspace-reports>` is `<workspace-root>/.claude/reports` for every topology.) The manifest lives in the gitignored reports tree, so it is personal and never committed.

**Format and tooling.** The manifest is **`run.json`** (schema `orchestration/run@1`,
validated by `lib/schema.mjs`). **Do not hand-write or hand-edit it** — use
`lib/manifest.mjs`, which re-validates on every mutation so the file is always
schema-valid and resumable:

```
node lib/manifest.mjs init    <run.json> <spec.json>          # creates it; captures per-member git baselines + seeds phases
node lib/manifest.mjs set     <run.json> <task-id> status=done verdict=approve user_verified=true
node lib/manifest.mjs set-run <run.json> integration_review=<path>   # run-level fields
node lib/manifest.mjs phase   <run.json> tasks_execution done  # advance a workflow phase (see below)
node lib/manifest.mjs gates   <run.json> <task-id> '{"convention":"pass","lint":"pass","test":"pass","build":"pass"}'
node lib/manifest.mjs status  <run.json> complete
node lib/manifest.mjs show    <run.json>                      # phase checklist + tasks + "RESUME AT: <first not-done task>"
```

**Workflow phases (programmatic).** The manifest carries a `phases` checklist — the
canonical workflow steps (`workspace → scope → plan → plan_approved → plan_review →
tasks_execution → integration_review → integrate`), each `pending|active|done|skipped|blocked`,
defined in `lib/schema.mjs` (not model prose). `init` seeds them (planning phases settled,
`tasks_execution` active); you **advance them with `manifest.mjs phase`** at each transition, and
`manifest.mjs show` renders the checklist so you and the user can see where the run is. This
is the deterministic "are we following the steps" tracker.

**`tasks_execution` expands per task.** `show` renders it, for every task in
`execution_order`, as three sub-steps — **execute → review → approval** — derived directly
from that task's own manifest fields (no separate storage, so nothing can drift): *execute* =
the assigned agent returned a report (`engineer_report`), *review* = a `verdict` was recorded,
*approval* = the user verified it (`user_verified`). So per-task progress is already tracked by
the normal `set`/`gates` calls; `tasks_execution` is the umbrella phase over all of them.
Advance: when every task is verified → `phase … tasks_execution done`; after the integration review →
`phase … integration_review done` (or `skipped`); at integrate → `phase … integrate done` then
`status complete`.

`init` takes a spec `{ ticket, topology, workspace_root, active_members:[{id,path}],
execution_order:[…], tasks:[{id,repo}], bundle? }` and fills the rest (baselines via git,
all tasks `not_started`). `bundle` is optional — omit it on the skip-architect path and it
defaults to `"inline"`. The shape it maintains: top-level `run/ticket/topology/bundle/
status/updated`, `active_members[].baseline`, `execution_order`, `tasks[]` (each with
`status`, `engineer_report`, `review`, `verdict`, `gates_observed` = the ORCHESTRATOR's
observed result not the assigned agent's claim, `user_verified`, `fix_rounds`), and
`integration_review`.

## Planning phase (architect path)

**The human reviews the plan first; the plan-reviewer is a second opinion afterward.** The user owns high-level scope and intent, so they see the plan before any automated review runs — the plan-reviewer's job is then to catch the lower-level gaps the user is likely to miss, against the plan the user has actually endorsed. Running it earlier wastes a pass on a plan that is about to change.

1. **Dispatch chuck-architect** with the user's request, any constraints, and the active member set (with each member's path + gate commands from the profile). Architect reads each active member, explores relevant code, decomposes the work into tasks (each with an `ASSIGNED_AGENT` and an `ASSIGNED_REPO` member, with order and dependencies), and writes a bundle. The bundle is workspace-level: it goes to `<workspace-root>/.claude/reports/chuck-architect/<ISO-timestamp>/` (uniform across topologies). Bundle contains `plan.md` (master) plus one `task-NN-<slug>.md` per task. Plan-review reports live alongside the bundle in the same workspace-level reports tree; engineer and code-review reports live in each touched member's own `reports_dir`.

2. **User review of the plan (first).** Present the bundle to the user with **clickable links to `plan.md` and each `task-NN-*.md`** so they read the real contracts, not a summary. Ask for feedback on the individual tasks and the overall approach. If the user wants changes → re-dispatch the architect with their feedback and re-present. Loop until the user approves the plan.

3. **Dispatch chuck-plan-reviewer (after user approval).** Pass the approved bundle path. Reviewer runs the `plan-review-rubric` skill once per task (deterministic per-task checks) plus a global synthesis pass (cross-task issues), and writes a single review file to `.claude/reports/chuck-plan-reviewer/<ISO-timestamp>.md` with `VERDICT: approve | revise | reject`.

4. **Surface the review to the user as a second opinion.** Link the review file and summarize its findings — these are gaps the user may have missed, not an automated gate. The user decides:
   - findings worth acting on → re-dispatch the architect with them, then back to step 2 (the user re-approves the changed plan).
   - findings they accept/waive, or a clean `approve` → give the final go.
   Do **not** loop the architect and plan-reviewer automatically without the human; the human directs what happens to the findings.

5. **Final go.** Once the user gives the go, the bundle is the source of truth — proceed to task dispatch (workflow step 5 above).

## Direct dispatch (skip-architect path)

For tickets the user has explicitly opted to skip planning on:

1. **Draft a single inline contract** following the task-file format used by chuck-architect (`TASK_ID`, `ASSIGNED_AGENT`, `ORDER=1`, `DEPENDS_ON=[]`, `GOAL`, `WHY`, `INTERFACE`, `UX` if applicable, `SCOPE_BOUNDARIES`, `FILES_AFFECTED`, `DONE_WHEN`, `ESCALATE_BACK_IF`).

2. **Confirm the contract with the user** before dispatch.

3. **Dispatch the contract's `ASSIGNED_AGENT`.** Pass the contract inline (no bundle path, since there is no bundle), plus the `ASSIGNED_REPO` member.

4. **Run the per-task gate** exactly as in workflow step 5's per-task mechanics: open a run manifest (skip-path location), capture the member baseline, read the report, **independently verify the gates**, dispatch `chuck-code-reviewer` for the one task, handle the verdict, and run the user verification gate. (This is a single-task run, so the execution-mode question does not apply — you verify the one task with the user.) Then integrate (step 8).

This path exists for speed on clearly trivial work. It does NOT support multi-task dispatch — for anything with more than one task, use the architect path.

## Hard gates

Reject a specialist's report if:
- Any project-defined check (convention, lint, tests) is `fail` **as observed by the orchestrator's own independent gate run** (step 5 sub-step 3) — the assigned agent's self-reported `pass` does not satisfy the gate on its own; a self-report that disagrees with the observed result is itself grounds to reject
- Files were edited outside the task's scope (domain or task `touch` paths)
- Required report sections are missing

Reject a plan-bundle review if:
- The reviewer did not invoke `plan-review-rubric` per task (you should see per-task findings in `PER-TASK FINDINGS`)
- The review lacks `VERDICT REASONING`
- The verdict is unsupported by the findings (e.g. `approve` despite critical findings)

Reject a code-review report if:
- The reviewer did not invoke `code-review-rubric` per task (you should see per-task findings in `PER-TASK FINDINGS`)
- The review lacks `VERDICT REASONING`
- The verdict is unsupported by the findings

Hard gates exist regardless of project. The specific checks to run are project-defined (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## Resuming an interrupted run

Work is checkpointed **on disk**, so a run can stop mid-execution (context limit, the user steps away, a crash) and resume without redoing finished work. On re-invocation, reconstruct state rather than starting over:

- **The run manifest is the primary checkpoint.** If a `run.json` exists for the run, run `node lib/manifest.mjs show <run.json>`: it prints each task's `status`/`verdict`/`user_verified`, the per-member baselines, and an explicit `RESUME AT: <first not-done task>` pointer. Resume there; do **not** re-dispatch tasks already `done`. The manifest replaces guessing — only fall back to scanning the reports tree if no manifest exists (older runs).
- **Setup interrupted** → a leftover `workspace.*.draft` (plus any partial `overrides.local.json`) is the checkpoint. `/orchestrate-config init` resumes from it (see that command).
- **Planning interrupted** (no manifest yet — it is created at the start of task dispatch) → if a bundle exists but has no plan-review next to it, resume at plan review; if it has an approved review but no manifest, resume at task dispatch (which opens the manifest).
- **Validate against reality.** The manifest is the source of truth for *intent*, but verify the working tree matches: a task marked `done` whose diff has vanished, or a `baseline` that no longer exists, is a conflict to **surface to the user**, not to silently re-run.
- **Always re-confirm the resume point with the user** before continuing — show what the manifest says is done and where you'll pick up.

## Failure modes

- **Checks fail in a specialist's report:** specialist returns `STATUS: blocked` with details. Decide whether to redispatch with a clarified brief or surface to the user.
- **Scope violation:** revert out-of-scope files; redispatch with stricter `SCOPE_BOUNDARIES`.
- **Architect bundle rejected by user:** stop. Re-clarify with the user before re-dispatching the architect. Don't loop until you understand what changed.
- **Reviewer keeps returning `revise`:** after two rounds, escalate to the user.
- **Specialist pushes back on a task:** treat as signal. Either revise the task with the user's input, or escalate to architect for replanning.
- **Code review fails (`revise`):** identify which task(s) the critical findings are tied to, build a fix contract from the findings, re-dispatch the relevant engineer. Cap at two fix-rounds per task before escalating to user.
- **Code review rejects:** implementation needs rework that patches won't fix. Often signals a problem in the plan that wasn't caught in plan-review. Re-engage architect or surface to user — don't loop directly back to the assigned agent.
